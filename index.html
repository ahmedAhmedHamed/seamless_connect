                    <p>
                        I wanted to make a project that I could use daily that solved a problem that I had and poses new challenges.
                        I frequently switch between my computer and phone, so I'm making an application that makes it possible 
                        to control one device to manage both. I also have the opportunity to learn advanced networking and Android 
                        development while working mainly with backend applications.
                    </p>
